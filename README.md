# File Explorer SPA

A single-page file explorer built with C# (.NET 9) and vanilla JavaScript. 

This proof-of-concept demonstrates file system browsing, searching, uploading, downloading, and basic file operations â€” all rendered client-side via deep-linkable URLs. No third-party frameworks present.
